# Character Counter

This is my first small project completed independently from Frontend Mentor. It is built using vanilla **HTML**, **SCSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## Features

- Toggle between **Light** and **Dark** themes
- Real-time text input handling
- Displays live statistics including:
  - Total Characters (excluding spaces)
  - Word Count
  - Sentence Count
  - Letter Density
- Ability to set a character limit
- Ability to include or exclude spaces from Total Characters
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This project was primarily focused on implementing and optimizing JavaScript functionality (character counting logic, theme switching, etc.). Responsive design was not implemented in this version, as the main goal was to demonstrate JavaScript skills. A responsive version may be added in future updates.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- SCSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

## How to Use

1. Type or paste your text into the input area.
2. Watch the statistics update instantly as you type.
3. Switch between light and dark mode using the theme toggle.
4. Set a character limit to restrict input length.
